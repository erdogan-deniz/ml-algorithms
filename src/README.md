# ML Algorithms

## Implementations of classical machine learning algorithms written with Pandas and NumPy.

`Classes`:
* LinearRegression—a class for working with a machine learning model—linear regression;
* LogisticRegression-a class for working with a machine learning model—logistic regression;
* ...

`Classes description`:
* LinearRegression: model training, forecasting using a model, choosing a loss function (`mse`), 
choosing a metric (`mae`, `rmse`, `r2`, `mape`, `mse`), using regularization (`l1`, `l2`, `elasticnet`),
choosing the learning rate (`function`, `int`), sgd (``), choice random_state;
* LogisticRegression: ...
